              I was working as an intern with Jungleworks, India. I was involved
              in developing the frontend for different product sites. Amazing
              and smooth UI experience was the main goal. My work includes
              imitating the UI prototypes, maintaining and performing A/B
              testing for product sites having 1+ million visitors per month.
              {/* For the first
              three months, I have picked up all the interest for marketing from
              here. Here, I was involved in setting facebook and google ads,
              making ad carousels for them and analyzing all the data collected
              from the ad campaigns to generate more SQL Leads. */}

              I got an opportunity to work for Innostax Software Labs. Here I
              was working as an associate software engineer. I was using
              react-redux as a frontend framework and express.js as backend and
              PostgreSQL as a database. My interest in data analytics grew from
              here. I got an opportunity to develop an analytical database for
              an overseas project. I was among the key contributors to the
              project.

              I took a break to reflect on my interests and to decide, how I
              want my career trajectory to be. I was interested in machine
              learning, deep learning, and computer vision. It is when I decided
              I want to combine my two interests i.e web development and machine
              learning and to go further in this field. COVID Made me reflect on
              my life choice and I decided to get out of my comfort zone to
              leave my hometown, my family, and my everything to come abroad for
              my Masters.
